    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tacos always bring party vibes, but when they’re baked until crisp and
      rimmed with crunchy cheesy frico, it’s an all-out fiesta. Featuring
      refried black beans stuffed inside a crunchy corn tortilla, this
      irresistible cross between a taco and a sheet-pan quesadilla will make any
      weeknight feel like a celebration. Oh—and did we mention you only need 5
      ingredients to get the party started?
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 Tbsp. neutral oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. taco seasoning</li>
      <li>1 (15.5-oz.) can black beans, drained, rinsed</li>
      <li>8 (6") yellow corn tortillas, warmed</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese</li>
      <li>
        Sour cream, cilantro leaves, and lime wedges, for serving (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425°. In a large skillet over
        medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Add onion, season with 1/2 teaspoon
        salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and sweet to the
        taste, about 7 minutes. Add taco seasoning and 1 tablespoon oil and
        cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beans, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a
        simmer over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, mashing
        down on some beans, until thickened and reduced, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
        from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a large metal baking sheet with remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
        Arrange tortillas in a single layer, making sure that one side of
        tortilla is coated in oil. Spoon a scant 1/4 cup bean mixture onto one
        half of each tortilla. Top each with 2 tablespoons cheese. Fold
        tortillas over cheese to create a taco. Flip tacos so side with cheese
        is closest to baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake tacos until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 8 to 10 minutes.
        Flip tacos and continue to bake until golden brown and crisp on the
        other side, 5 to 8 minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer tacos to a platter. Serve with sour cream, cilantro, and lime
        wedges alongside (if using).
      </li>
    </ol>
