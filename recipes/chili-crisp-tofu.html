    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14-oz.) pkg. extra-firm tofu</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chili crisp (mostly the crisp solids)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tsp. cornstarch, divided</li>
      <li>1/3 cup neutral oil</li>
      <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced, for serving</li>
      <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove tofu from package; discard excess moisture. On a cutting board,
        holding knife parallel to board, slice tofu block in half to yield 2
        thinner blocks. Cut each block into 12 cubes about 1" x 1" each. Arrange
        in an 8" x 8" baking dish in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a kettle or medium pot, bring 6 cups water to a boil. Pour water over
        tofu; sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. salt. Let sit 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk chili crisp, honey, soy sauce, and 2
        tsp. cornstarch. Place remaining 1/3 cup cornstarch in another small
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line half of a baking sheet with 2 layers of paper towels or a clean
        kitchen towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one or two at a time, remove tofu cubes from water and blot dry
        on all sides with more paper towels. Arrange on paper towels on prepared
        sheet. Cover with more paper towels or another clean kitchen towel and
        lightly pat dry again (do not apply too much pressure).
      </li>
      <li>
        Working one or two at a time, transfer tofu cubes to cornstarch and toss
        to coat. Shake of excess and transfer to unlined part of baking sheet.
        Remove wet paper towels from baking sheet and line with fresh paper
        towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large, heavy, high-sided stainless steel or cast-iron skillet over
        medium-high heat, heat oil until shimmering. Fry tofu in a single layer,
        turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes.
        Transfer to prepared sheet; season with salt, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour off remaining oil into a heatproof bowl (discard once cool). Return
        skillet to medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk chili crisp sauce to reincorporate and pour into skillet. Bring to
        a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, 30 to 60 seconds. Add tofu
        and toss in sauce until coated and warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>Divide rice among bowls. Top with tofu mixture and scallions.</li>
    </ol>
